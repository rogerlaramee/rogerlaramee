# 👋 Hi, I'm Roger Laramée

**Cybersecurity & Risk Professional in Transition | Data Engineering Learner | Commercial Insurance & GRC Background**

I’m based in the **Gatineau–Ottawa** region and I’m building a blended profile at the intersection of:

- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity & GRC** (governance, risk & compliance)
- 📊 **Risk Management & Insurance** (commercial damage, liability, cyber risk)
- 🧮 **Data Engineering & Analytics** (Python, data pipelines, automation)

---

## 🎯 What I’m working on (2025–2030)

- Transitioning from **commercial insurance brokerage** into **cybersecurity & data-driven risk management**
- Building a portfolio of:
  - Cybersecurity labs and notes
  - GRC & risk analysis scripts
  - Data engineering learning projects
- Designing a personal brand around **RogerLaramée.com**

---

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Focus

- Foundations: **Networking, Linux, Endpoint Security, Network Defense**
- Pathways:
  - GRC / Governance, Risk & Compliance
  - SOC & Security Monitoring
  - Cyber risk for **transport & trade** (import/export, logistics, cargo)

You’ll find in my repos:

- 🧪 **`cybersecurity-labs`** – step-by-step labs, notes, and exercises  
- 📜 **`grc-risk-scripts`** – experiments with controls, risk scoring, and automation  

---

## 📊 Data Engineering & Analytics

I’m learning:

- Python for scripting & automation
- Data workflows (collect → clean → analyze)
- How to apply data to **risk & cybersecurity decisions**

Repos:

- 📂 **`data-engineering-learning`** – notebooks, mini-projects, and practice datasets  
- 🤖 **`ai-assist-tools`** – experiments using AI to support risk, cyber, and analytics work

## 🧩 Background in Insurance & Risk

Before cyber/data, I worked in:

- 🏢 **Commercial damage insurance brokerage**
- 📋 **Risk management & claims**
- 🚛 Interest in **transportation & trade** (logistics, marine/import-export cargo risk)

I’m especially interested in **bridging the gap** between:

> Traditional insurance risk + Cybersecurity risk + Data-driven decision-making

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies (in progress)

- **Languages:** Python (beginner → intermediate path)  
- **Concepts:** Information Security, GRC, Risk Management, Networking, Linux  
- **Learning stack:** Cisco NetAcad, ISC2, books like *The Essentials of Risk Management* and *How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk*
